* You may notice a message at the bottom of the page that says that `MetaMask cannot recover your seedphrase`, it means that once you import your keys, MetaMask won't export them again, so if you lose your mnemonic you can't extract it from MetaMask; keep your mnemonics in a safe place!

* Click on the "All Done" button to continue; you will see a page showing the balance of your wallet and the transaction history.

 ![MetaMask installation - 9](Images/metamask-9.png)

* You may note that you have `0 ETH` and no transactions. This is all right from now since you are not connected to your local blockchain.

Congratulations! You have installed MetaMask.
