![alt-text](auto_lot.png)

### Goal:
Non-fungible tokenized auto auction, built with a Smart Contract and deployed to a decentralized blockchain dApp that uses ChatBot functionalities to easily interact with highest bidders.

Create an ethereum smart contract that will digitize the used car market place. 
Allowing anyone with a vehicle to tokenize their vehicle and set the minimum value they would accept in trade.

### Functionality:
Front-end Conversational User Interfaces (CUI's, i.e ChatBot) that collects sellers vehicle information to be auctioned and allows prospective buyers to place bids in a decentralized auction.
